Explain_ml can be used to detect interactions using partial dependence and produce PD and ICE plots to visualize non-linearity.

We recommend you look at the tutorial in the Examples folder (Example_icepd.ipynb) for an overview of the important functionality.

Features:

Partial dependence (PD):
- PD plots for 1D and 2D
- Ensemble options for 1D plots to show uncertainity
- Gradient of PD for 1D plots
- Linear model comparison for 1D plots
- PD plots for 1D One Hot Encoded variables
- Distributions of variable shown

Individual Conditional Expectation Plots (ICE): 
- ICE plots for 1D
- Gradients available
- Ensemble option

Interactions:
- H-statistics using PD
- H-statistics using PD for null distribution
- Statistical significance interaction detection
- LASSO interaction detection
- Bidirectional stepwise detection (not recommended)
- GUIDE algorithm interaction detection (not recommended when collinearity present)


Installation Guide

Python version 3.7 is required.
